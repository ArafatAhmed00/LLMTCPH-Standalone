For the given question, generate the fastest running query in SQLite that fulfills its requirements. Think step by step in <scratchpad> tags BEFORE giving your final answer.

Put your final answer in <query> tags. Include only the SQL query in your final answer. Do not include any explanations, comments, or additional information. Your answer must start with "<query>" and end with "</query>". Anything outside these tags will be ignored and may cause execution errors. Your response ALWAYS ends with "</query>".
